  <p>
    I’m a Master’s student in Information Management at the University of Illinois 
    Urbana-Champaign. Before grad school, I spent three years as a software engineer 
    building and improving distributed storage systems for enterprise workloads. 
    My work focused on performance, reliability, and scale, using C/C++, Python, 
    and Go, plus modern tooling like Docker and Kubernetes. I have hands-on experience
    with block-device internals, RAID-style replication, and low-latency I/O (e.g., NVMe/SPDK), 
    and I enjoy taking projects from design to production-quality code.

    On the data side, I’ve completed projects in data science and analytics where I cleaned data,
    wrote efficient SQL, and built clear dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to support decisions. 
    I’m comfortable building end-to-end data pipelines in Python and I value simple, 
    well-tested code and clear communication.
